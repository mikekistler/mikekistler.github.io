I am a Principal Product Manager at Microsoft working on the .NET Platform team.
I previously worked in the Azure SDK team and before that at IBM building tools to produce SDKs, API documentation, CLIs, and more.

I am passionate about HTTP APIs and developer experience and building tools to make developers more productive.

I also love learning new things and sharing what I learn with others.

All opinions are my own.
